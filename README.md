# AdvancedTonemappingUnrealPlugin
The overall goal of this plugin is to add better tonemapping options to unreal engine.
Currently the only additional tonemapper added is the display_transform from 
h3r2tic's notorious6 project.

This plugin relies on https://github.com/kriNon/AdvancedTonemappingUnrealPlugin to work.
